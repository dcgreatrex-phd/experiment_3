# Overview:

Experiment 3 used a 4 Hz periodic rhythm (IOI of 250 ms) to investigate whether periodicity affects complex auditory averaging decisions during fast stimulus presentation. This was 1 Hz faster than that the 3 Hz rate used in experiments 1 and 2 (IOI of 333 ms) and was the second fastest rate used by other auditory studies in the timing literatures according to the review in the introduction of chapter 5. The task required making a relative auditory averaging decision between the perceived spatial location of a lateralized rhythmic sound sequence and a probe tone. It was hypothesised that IOI variance would strongly affect decision latencies and that periodic sequences would be responded to faster than aperiodic sequences. Periodicity was also expected to enhance choice accuracy if the responses were similar to experiment 1. This is because participants were given no information about the timing of the rhythmic sequence prior to each trial, a situation similar to experiment 1. It was unknown, however, what effect the decision refractory period described by Wyart(2012) would have on responses.

# Requirements:

MATLAB (MathWorks) - the program was build in version R2015b. Psychtoolbox3 (http://psychtoolbox.org/) - version 3.0.13 - Flavor: beta - Corresponds to SVN Revision 8038.

# Installation:

Clone the respository to a local folder and set MATLABs current directory to the selected folder. Enter 'averaging_threshold' into the MATLAB terminal to start the experiment. Be sure to change any hard coded URLs in ‘averaging_threshold’ to represent the folder directory of your computer.
